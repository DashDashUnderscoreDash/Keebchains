# How to do multicolor prints in Bambu Studio

## 1. Open Bambu Studio, create a new project, and load the model into the program
For this example I will use the [Denali keebchain model](https://github.com/DashDashUnderscoreDash/Keebchains/blob/main/Models/Denali%20by%20HaiZeus/Model/Denali%20Keychain.stl)

## 2. Set up your print settings with your preferences
### Common settings you may adjust are:
   - Layer height
   - Infill density
   - Infill pattern
   - Wall count
   - Enable supports (Highly suggested)
   - *With my Bambu P1S using a 0.4mm nozzle and printing with PLA, I set my models up as 0.16 layers, 2 walls, 15% gyroid infill, supports enabled with default settings*

## 3. Set up the paint tool to enable the coloring of the model
   - The paint tool is located in the top ribbon
   - You must have the model selected to be able to click the icon

   - Select the paint fill tool

   - Select the edge detection option

## 6. Ensure you have the amount of colors you'd like to use mirror the available project filaments
   - For each AMS you have you will need 4 colors selected

   - *The colors do not have to match your final colors you print in as you choose those when you go to print the file, so organize this as you see fit*

## 5. Paint the model how you would like
   - Now that you have the paint bucket tool selected and the edge detection enabled you can hover over the different parts of the model and click them to color the highlighted areas

![Step6.2](https://github.com/DashDashUnderscoreDash/Keebchains/blob/main/Bambu%20AMS%20Tutorial/Images/Step6.2.png)
   - *Keep in mind the more colors you use and how often they switch will lead to higher print times and more filament waste from the AMS switching colors*

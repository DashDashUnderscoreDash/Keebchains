# How to do multicolor prints in Bambu Studio

## 1. Open Bambu Studio, create a new project, and load the model into the program
For this example I will use the [Denali keebchain model](https://github.com/DashDashUnderscoreDash/Keebchains/blob/main/Models/Denali%20by%20HaiZeus/Model/Denali%20Keychain.stl)

## 2. Set up your print settings with your preferences
### Common settings you may adjust are:
   - Layer height
   - Infill density
   - Infill pattern
   - Wall count
   - Enable supports (Highly suggested)
   - *With my Bambu P1S using a 0.4mm nozzle and printing with PLA, I set my models up as 0.16 layers, 2 walls, 15% gyroid infill, supports enabled with default settings*

## 3. Paint the model to utilize the AMS and multicolor prints
